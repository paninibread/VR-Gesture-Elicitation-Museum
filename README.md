## Description

This project conducts a gesture elicitation study in Virtual Reality (VR) for spherical displays in museums, specifically designed for the Oculus Quest 2 headset. The study aims to understand how users interact with spherical displays in VR environments, providing insights into user behavior and preferences for future exhibit designs.

## Frameworks Used
- Unity
- OculusSDK with Hand Tracking

## Features
* Hand Tracking
   - Utilizes the hand tracking feature of the Oculus Quest 2 headset to accurately track the user's hand movements and gestures in the VR environment.

* Hand Gesture Support
   - Supports various hand gestures including select, pinch, poke, grab, and two-handed object manipulation, allowing users to interact with virtual objects and displays naturally.

## Study Design

* Participants in the study wear the Oculus Quest 2 headset and are immersed in the VR environment.
* They are instructed to interact with the displays using hand gestures, exploring different interaction techniques and providing feedback on their experience.
* The study collects data on user gestures, preferences, and usability metrics to inform the design of spherical displays in museum exhibits.

The Gesture Elicitation Study for Spherical Displays in Museums using Oculus Quest 2 offers valuable insights into user interaction with VR exhibits. By leveraging Unity and OculusSDK with Hand Tracking, the study provides a realistic and immersive VR experience for participants to explore and interact with spherical displays. The findings from the study contribute to the design and development of more engaging and intuitive museum exhibits, enhancing the visitor experience in virtual environments.
